# Write a function called keyword_counter that takes three parameters
# Parameter one should be a list of words.
# The second should be a Boolean
# The third should be either a string or a filename
# The first parameter is your list of keywords.
# The second parameter if set to True means that the third parameter is a string
# The second parameter if set to False means that the third parameter is a filename
# In both cases, you will need to read a string and count occurrences of each
# keyword in that string. If the third parameter is a string, you can use that
# directly. If it is a filename, then you need to read the contents of a file
# into a string first. Then search for occurrences.
# Your function must return a dictionary with the keywords as the key and the 
# count of occurrences of that keyword as the value. 
# Since this is tricky, I've given you the code to read from a file that you'll
# need to include in your function.
# NOTE: Your test should not be case sensitive so if
# one of the words is "fish" your function should count 
# "fish", "Fish", "FISH" or any other combination of 
# capitalization as an occurrence.
